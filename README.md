## About

This game of scrabble is to further experience with JQuery UI along with the other components of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we have learned.
Only part of the game will be implemented, not the entire game since it will only use one line of the scrabble board and a single tile rack
that will line up to seven different tiles. It will allow the user to drag the different tiles onto the line to make a word, and then after
it would output the total score.

## Website

You can find the game at https://theknackattack.github.io/scrabble/.

## Features That Work

I was able to implement the board and rack themselves that are placed in the center of the page. In addition, I was able to get the tiles to
randomly generate and once you click on the 'Draw Tiles' button they will give you a new set of tiles if you were not satisfied with the old
set. You are also able to drag them around the page and once you let go of them, they will automatically return to their original position.

## Features That Didn't Work

I failed to get the feature to work where the boxes for placing the tiles are generated and you can then place them in there. It seems to be
more of an issue where I tried to generate boxes altogether rather than separately generating them to be treated as individual entities. In
addition to that, I didn't have enough time to implement the point system for placing the tiles inside the boxes since I ended up starting
this assignment later than usual so that falls on me.
