## About

This game of scrabble is to further experience with JQuery UI along with the other components of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript we have learned.
Only part of the game will be implemented, not the entire game since it will only use one line of the scrabble board and a single tile rack
that will line up to seven different tiles. It will allow the user to drag the different tiles onto the line to make a word, and then after
it would output the total score.
